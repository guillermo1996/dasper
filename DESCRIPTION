Description: The aim of dasper is to detect aberrant splicing events 
  from RNA-seq data. dasper will use as input both junction and 
  coverage data from RNA-seq to calculate the deviation of each 
  splicing event in a patient from a set of user-defined controls. 
  dasper uses an unsupervised outlier detection algorithm to score each 
  splicing event in the patient with an outlier score representing 
  the degree to which that splicing event looks abnormal.
