\title{Load junctions from RNA-sequencing data}
\usage{
junction_load(
  junction_paths,
  metadata = dplyr::tibble(samp_id = stringr::str_c("samp_", seq_along(junction_paths))),
  controls = rep(FALSE, length(junction_paths)),
  load_func = .STAR_load,
  chrs = NULL,
  coord_system = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{junction_paths}{path(s) to junction data.}

\item{metadata}{data.frame containing sample metadata with rows in the same
order as \code{junction_paths}.}

\item{controls}{either a logical vector of the same length as
\code{junction_paths} with TRUE representing controls. Or, one of "fibroblasts",
"lymphocytes", "skeletal_muscle", "whole_blood" representing the samples of
which GTEx tissue to use as controls. By default, will assume all samples
are patients.}

\item{load_func}{function to load in junctions. By default, requires STAR
formatted junctions (SJ.out). But this can be switched dependent on the
format of the user's junction data. Function must take as input a junction
path then return a data.frame with the columns "chr", "start", "end",
"strand" and "count".}

\item{chrs}{chromosomes to keep. By default, no filter is applied.}

\item{coord_system}{1 (1-based) or 0 (0-based) denoting the co-ordinate
system corresponding to the user junctions from \code{junction_paths}. Only used
when controls is set to "fibroblasts" to ensure GTEx data is harmonised to
match the co-ordinate system of the user's junctions.}
}
\value{
\link[SummarizedExperiment:RangedSummarizedExperiment-class]{RangedSummarizedExperiment-class}
object containing junction data.
}
\description{
\code{junction_load} loads in raw patient and control junction data and formats it
into a
\link[SummarizedExperiment:RangedSummarizedExperiment-class]{RangedSummarizedExperiment-class}
object. Control samples can be the user's in-house samples or selected from
GTEx v6 data publicly released through the
\href{https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/}{recount2} and
downloaded through \href{http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu/}{snaptron}. By default,
\code{junction_load} expects the junction data to be in STAR aligned format
(SJ.out) but this can be modified via the argument \code{load_func}.
